# Week14RESTControllerAndDependencyInjection

This week we added an info-level Logging statement via Lombok in the controller implementation method, saw how the application sends an HTTP GET request to the server from a browser, added a service layer to the package. We added database dependencies, created an application.yaml file, added the H2 database and dependency, created an application-test.yaml file.
